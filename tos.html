<h1>General</h1>
<p>
    By using "NAT64 by Daniel Richter"(from now and called "the service" or "this service") you agree to comply with the
    <a href="/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>(ToS).
</p>
<p>
    I may change the TOS and/or SLA at any time without further notice.
</p>
<h1>Liability</h1>
<p>
    I take no responsibility for any damage or harm caused by users of this service to others, or by others to users of
    this service.
    The service is simply a gateway that translates packets between different protocols and is not concerned with the
    content of a packet.
    In compliance with the GDPR I will not and must not analyze the content of packets or log IP addresses. If you
    suspect that
    someone is abusing the service please send an abuse report at <a href="mailto:nat64@danielrichter.codes">nat64@danielrichter.codes</a>
    and if
    reasonable I will block IP addresses or address ranges temporarily or permanently.
</p>
<h1>Forbidden Actions</h1>
<p>
    You are not allowed to use this service for illegal actions in Germany or the EU. This means especially, but not
    only
</p>
<ul>
    <li>DDoS Attacks to or from the service</li>
    <li>Abusing security breaches or vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Sending spam</li>
    <li>Accessing or downloading copyright protected or otherwise illegal content</li>
</ul>
<h1>Service Level Agreement</h1>
<p>
    The service is provided as is, for free, without any warranties.
    You may use the service in any capacity you like, but there are now guaranties for bandwith, latency, uptime or
    other
    performance characteristics. This service is primarily run to educate myself and others and provide practical
    examples.
    If you have stricter requirements you may find a suitable option at https://nat64.net/public-providers.

    If the service gets used in ways that are undesirable to me, e.g. lots of abuse reports, few people using all the
    bandwith,
    I may decide to block users or throttle them to maintain overall stability of the service.

</p>
<h1>Data Usage</h1>
<p>
    I don't collect any personalized data according to the GDPR, especially not IP Adresses, however I may aggregate
    them to create and publish global anonymous usage statistics.
